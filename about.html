        <p>I am Tejashri. I love to bake and experiment in the kitchen. My kitchen is my safe haven and happy place. I bake when I am stressed, when I am happy, when I am tensed and even when I am sad. So, I thought why not make money out of it. That was the start of Cafe Brew.. I have always been a huge caffeine consumer; drinking coffee after waking up, after going to work, in the meetings, in the evenings, before going to bed and anywhere in between. At some point, I realized that I actually couldn't survive without my daily dose of coffee and that is where Cafe Brew's tagline comes from.</p>
